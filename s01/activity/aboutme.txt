Keith Maverick Alvarez

I join this open house, because I want to learn more about HTML and CSS. And also different related software to pursue my dream of becoming a web developer.

I currently am handling a business on an online selling platform, and I get to experience organizing files, organizing the store page, keeping track of orders, etc.
